### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Keelan, and I am an aspiring Front End Web Developer. 

I'm learning to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQUERY, PHP, and SQL to eventually create large scale Print Ecommerce websites, for Print companies nationally, and soon internationally. I am currently in a Tech Support role, but will soon be graduating up to a Front End Web Developer role with my peers.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
